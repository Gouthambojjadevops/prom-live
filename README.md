This is the repository for the live webinar:

***Monitoring Linux and Kubernetes with Prometheus in 3 hours***

All of the labs can be found within.

## Prometheus & Linux

Although you can get away with a single Linux system for this course, I highly recommend that you ready at least two, local, Linux virtual machines. One to run Prometheus, and the other to be monitored.

The scripts and labs are designed for **Ubuntu** 22.04 Server or **Debian** 12 server (x64 platform). Work as root or as a user with sudo powers. 

If you don't have either Debian or Ubuntu you can download them from the following links.

- Debian 12 [Download](https://www.debian.org/download)
- Ubuntu 22.04 Server [Download](https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/ubuntu-22.04.4-live-server-amd64.iso)

> Note: If you choose to run Debian, make sure that you install it as a server. To do so, deselect any desktops (GNOME, KDE, etc...) during the Task Selection phase of the installation. 

Most importantly, to install Prometheus see [this link](./prometheus-install/README.md).

## Kubernetes

You might also be interested in running, and monitoring, Kubernetes. During the course I'll be monitoring the following:





- Vanilla Kubernetes cluster (three Ubuntu systems running locally in KVM).
- A MiniKube
- Amazon EKS
- Google K8s



For instructions on how to install a vanilla K8s cluster see this link  ........
